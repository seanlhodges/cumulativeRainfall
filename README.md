Cumulative Rainfall Review
==========================
Daily rainfall totals over time can can be compared to long term averages. Daily totals will vary depending on prevailing weather conditions and will show wetter or dryer periods than average.

This routine sets out to present trends around the long term average over a Jul-Jun 12 month period (southern hemisphere Winter-Spring-Summer-Autumn-Winter period). This is useful in assessing likelihood of droughty conditions if prevailing rainfall is trending low from the beginning of a period.

Droughty conditions from previous 12 month periods can be assessed based on a configurable **year** variable, but values do not carry through from year to year.
